# 24:60

I was wondering why it is that our timekeeping system always starts from 00:00 (12 am) & counts all the way up till 24:00. What if it was the other way around? Us humans always tend to make the most out of something when we see it disappearing right before our eyes. For example, you feel more compelled to complete a task when you have a timer counting down, not up. There’s just something special about the number 0. It’s absolute. Closed. No second chance. The end.

Anyway, I made this little app to try out the concept.
